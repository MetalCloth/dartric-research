  "summary": "Stores detailed information about individual music tracks.",
  "purpose": "To catalog all music tracks available in the system, providing essential metadata such as the track's name, its associated album, media type, genre, composer, duration, file size, and unit price. It serves as the primary repository for track-specific data, enabling playback, searching, and purchasing functionalities.",
  "dependencies_thoughts": "This table is central to the music catalog. It relates to the `album` table (album_id to album_id) to link tracks to their respective albums, the `media_type` table (media_type_id to media_type_id) to specify the format of the track, and the `genre` table (genre_id to genre_id) to categorize tracks by musical style. Records in this table depend on the existence of IDs in these parent tables.",
