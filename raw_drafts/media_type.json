  "summary": "A reference table storing distinct categories or types of media.",
  "purpose": "This table provides a standardized list of media formats or genres. Its primary purpose is to allow other tables (like 'track') to categorize their media content consistently by referencing a `media_type_id`, thereby ensuring data integrity and simplifying content management.",
  "dependencies_thoughts": "This table is a standalone lookup table, acting as a parent for other tables that might need to classify media. It does not have any foreign key dependencies on other tables, but its primary key (`media_type_id`) is designed to be referenced by child tables (e.g., `track`) to categorize their media items.",
