  "name": "payment_p2022_04",
  "summary": "A partitioned table storing individual payment transactions for April 2022, detailing the amount, date, and linking to the customer, staff, and associated rental.",
  "purpose": "This table captures all payment events related to rentals specifically for April 2022. It serves to track financial transactions, attribute payments to specific customers and rental agreements, and record which staff member processed the payment. Its name suggests it is a time-based partition of a larger `payment` table, optimized for performance and data management.",
  "dependencies_thoughts": "This table is dependent on the `customer`, `rental`, and `staff` tables, as each payment record must refer to an existing customer, a rental transaction, and a staff member who processed it. It is likely a partition of a larger `payment` table, indicating a time-series or range partitioning strategy.",
