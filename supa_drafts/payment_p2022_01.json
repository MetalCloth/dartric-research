  "name": "payment_p2022_01",
  "summary": "A partitioned table recording individual payment transactions for January 2022.",
  "purpose": "This table stores detailed records of financial payments made, likely for rental services. It links each payment to the specific customer, the staff member who processed it, and the associated rental event. The `_p2022_01` suffix and inclusion of `payment_date` in the primary key indicate this table is part of a time-based partitioning scheme, optimizing for querying and managing large volumes of payment data for specific periods.",
  "dependencies_thoughts": "This table serves as a transactional record, establishing a relationship with the `customer` table (customer_id), the `staff` table (staff_id), and the `rental` table (rental_id). All records in this table depend on the existence of corresponding entries in these parent tables. The composite primary key including `payment_date` is indicative of a partitioning strategy.",
