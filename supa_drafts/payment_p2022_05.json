  "summary": "Records individual payment transactions, likely for a specific month as part of a partitioned table.",
  "purpose": "To store detailed financial transactions, linking payments to specific customers, staff members, and rentals. The `_p2022_05` suffix strongly suggests this table is a partition for payment data specifically from May 2022, optimizing data management and query performance for time-series payment records.",
  "dependencies_thoughts": "This table is a core transaction record, relying on the `customer` table (via customer_id), the `staff` table (via staff_id), and the `rental` table (via rental_id) for referential integrity. Its composite primary key, including `payment_date`, indicates it's likely a time-based partition.",
