  "summary": "A lookup table storing definitions and details for various categories.",
  "purpose": "This table defines and stores different categories, each with a unique identifier, name, and optional descriptive details. It is designed to allow other tables (e.g., products, articles, services) to classify their records, enabling efficient filtering, grouping, and organization of data based on these categories.",
  "dependencies_thoughts": "This table acts as a dimension or lookup table. While no explicit foreign key constraints are defined here, it is highly probable that other tables (such as 'products', 'items', or 'posts') will contain a `category_id` column that references `categories.category_id` to classify their respective records.",
