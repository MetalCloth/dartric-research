  "summary": "A partitioned table storing individual payment transactions for July 2022.",
  "purpose": "This table records financial transactions made by customers for rentals, detailing the amount, the date, and the associated customer, staff, and rental. The `_p2022_07` suffix indicates it's a specific monthly partition of a larger `payment` table, designed for efficient management and querying of historical payment data.",
  "dependencies_thoughts": "This table is a partition of a main `payment` table, implicitly relating to `customer` (via `customer_id`), `staff` (via `staff_id`), and `rental` (via `rental_id`) tables. While explicit foreign key constraints are not declared, these columns are clearly intended as foreign keys.",
